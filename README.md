Hello,

I'm Denis, a networking and Go enthusiast based in France. I enjoy exploring network technologies and developing in Go. Here are some of my projects:

🚀 place-test: A public pixel art canvas deployed on my home k8 cluster.

📡 dhcp: An implementation of DHCP server from scratch.

🕷️ spider-bot: A simple telegram-bot to manage home tarantulas and cricket colony on Rust.

Feel free to explore my repositories and connect with me. Let's improve the network, one packet at a time. 😊

Happy coding! 🎉
